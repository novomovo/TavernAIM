                <i>The method is outdated and was used in the early days of AI chats. This was needed for increase length of message from AI in narrative models such as Nerys and Erebus, because in the default chat mode, these models answered quite briefly. This models were trained using descriptors of the type [Writing style: *some style*]. Accordingly, by specifying information about the length of messages in the descriptors, we get longer messages. At the moment it will also work with Nerys and Erebus models.</i>
                <p><u>Character Anchor</u> - affects the character played by the AI by motivating him to write longer messages. Looks like [Alexa talks a lot with descriptions]</p>
                <p><u>Style Anchor</u> - affects all AI model, motivating AI to write longer messages. Looks like [Writing style: very long messages]</p>
                <hr style="opacity: 0.6;"><p>Anchors Order sets the location of anchors in the promt, the first anchor in the order is much higher and has less influence than second.</p>
                <p>The second in order anchor is turned on after 8-12 messages, because the first anchor is enough when there are few messages.</p>
                <p>Sometimes some AI models may not perceive anchors correctly or the AI model already generates sufficiently long messages, so for these cases, to disable anchors, you just need to uncheck the boxes.</p>
                <br><p>*It is automatically disabled in Pygmalion, since Pygmalion already generates long enough messages</p>
